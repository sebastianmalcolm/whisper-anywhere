# Implementation Plan: Add API Provider Choice

This document provides an overview of the implementation plan for adding API provider choice to the Whisper Anywhere Chrome extension. For detailed technical specifications, see the following documents:

- [Provider Interfaces](docs/implementation/provider-interfaces.md)
- [Configuration Structures](docs/implementation/configuration.md)
- [Migration Strategy](docs/implementation/migration.md)
- [Testing & Security](docs/implementation/testing-security.md)
- [Prompting & Use Cases](docs/implementation/prompting-and-use-cases.md)

## Implementation Stages

The implementation is divided into six stages, each with its own branch and focused changes. For a high-level overview and progress tracking, see [High-Level Implementation Plan](docs/plans/ProviderChoiceOfAI-HighLevelImplementationPlan-IncExampleTypescriptInterfaces.md).

### Stage 1: Configuration Infrastructure
**Branch:** `feature/provider-config-infrastructure`

Set up the foundation for provider configuration. See [Configuration Structures](docs/implementation/configuration.md) for detailed implementation.

### Stage 2: Provider Service Layer
**Branch:** `feature/provider-service-layer`

Create the provider abstraction layer. See [Provider Interfaces](docs/implementation/provider-interfaces.md) for detailed implementation.

### Stage 3: Service Integration
**Branch:** `feature/integrate-provider-services`

Integrate provider services with existing functionality. Implementation details are spread across the technical documentation files.

### Stage 4: UI Components
**Branch:** `feature/provider-selection-ui`

Add user interface for provider selection and configuration. See the UI sections in each technical document for component details.

### Stage 5: Migration Support
**Branch:** `feature/provider-migration`

Add support for migrating existing configuration. See [Migration Strategy](docs/implementation/migration.md) for detailed implementation.

### Stage 6: Documentation & Polish
**Branch:** `feature/provider-docs`

Complete documentation and final polish. This includes updating all technical documentation and the main README.

## Key Considerations

### Security
See [Testing & Security](docs/implementation/testing-security.md) for detailed security considerations including:
- Token storage
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- Error handling

### Testing
See [Testing & Security](docs/implementation/testing-security.md) for the complete testing strategy including:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Performance monitoring

### Migration
See [Migration Strategy](docs/implementation/migration.md) for detailed migration procedures including:
- Configuration migration
- Data preservation
- Rollback procedures

## Success Criteria

1. Technical:
   - Audio preprocessing meets provider requirements
   - All supported file types work correctly
   - Error handling provides clear guidance
   - Configuration migration is smooth

2. User Experience:
   - Clear model selection guidance
   - Accurate cost estimates
   - Informative error messages
   - Smooth provider switching

3. Performance:
   - Audio processing is efficient
   - API responses are handled promptly
   - UI remains responsive

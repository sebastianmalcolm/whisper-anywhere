# Implementation Plan: Add API Provider Choice

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for adding API provider choice to the Whisper Anywhere Chrome extension. Each step represents a distinct branch that will be created from the main branch, with changes that are focused and reviewable.

## Stage 1: Configuration Infrastructure
**Branch:** `feature/provider-config-infrastructure`

Add infrastructure for storing provider configuration:
- [ ] Modify `src/app/config.ts` to support:
  - [ ] Selected provider storage
  - [ ] Multiple provider tokens
  - [ ] Provider-specific settings
- [ ] Add provider configuration types
- [ ] Add initial provider definitions (OpenAI, Groq)

## Stage 2: Provider Service Layer
**Branch:** `feature/provider-service-layer`

Create abstraction layer for API providers:
- [ ] Create `src/app/services/providers/` directory
- [ ] Add provider interface definition
- [ ] Implement OpenAI provider (current functionality)
- [ ] Implement Groq provider
- [ ] Add provider factory/registry

## Stage 3: Service Integration
**Branch:** `feature/integrate-provider-services`

Modify existing services to use provider layer:
- [ ] Update `transcriber.ts` to use selected provider
- [ ] Update `enhancer.ts` to use selected provider
- [ ] Add provider-specific error handling
- [ ] Add provider capability detection

## Stage 4: UI Components
**Branch:** `feature/provider-selection-ui`

Add UI for provider selection and configuration:
- [ ] Create provider selection component
- [ ] Update popup UI to include provider selection
- [ ] Add provider-specific token input fields
- [ ] Add provider capability indicators

## Stage 5: Migration Support
**Branch:** `feature/provider-migration`

Add support for migrating existing configuration:
- [ ] Add migration logic for existing OpenAI tokens
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Add fallback handling
- [ ] Update error messages for provider-specific issues

## Stage 6: Documentation & Polish
**Branch:** `feature/provider-docs`

Complete documentation and polish:
- [ ] Update README with provider configuration
- [ ] Add provider-specific troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Update screenshots
- [ ] Add provider capability comparison table

## Technical Details

See detailed implementation files in `/docs/implementation/`:
- [Provider Interfaces](../implementation/provider-interfaces.md)
- [Configuration Structures](../implementation/configuration.md)
- [Migration Strategy](../implementation/migration.md)
- [Testing & Security](../implementation/testing-security.md)

## Pull Request Review Guidelines

Each PR should:
1. Focus on a single stage of implementation
2. Include clear before/after screenshots for UI changes
3. Document configuration changes
4. Include migration steps if needed
5. Update relevant documentation
6. Include test coverage for new functionality

## Rollback Plan

Each stage includes:
1. Reversion steps
2. Configuration cleanup
3. User data preservation steps
4. Fallback behavior

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can select between API providers
- [ ] Provider configuration is persisted
- [ ] Existing functionality works with all providers
- [ ] Clear error messages for provider-specific issues
- [ ] Smooth migration path for existing users
- [ ] Updated documentation reflecting new capabilities
